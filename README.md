### What is fuzzy Search?

A fuzzy search algorithm is designed to find approximate matches for a given search query. 

Let's say you have a list of products, and a user is looking for a "Czy Swetr,". Exact match will return nothing, but the fuzzy search will find "Cozy Sweater.".

If you need exact match - you need to use standard function `.filter { }` instead of this library.

## Difference: Ifrit VS Fuze-Swift?
```diff
- Fuze-Swift: Swift 5.1~
+ Ifrit: Swift 6.2 compatible

+ Fuze-Swift support Pods and Packages :)
- Ifrit supports only Packages :(

- Fuze-Swift is dead :(
+ ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ Ifrit is Fuse-Swift, reborn from the hells ashes! But more powerful and alive than ever! ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥ :)

- Fuse-Swift supports asynchronous functions with callbacks but lacks native async/await support. :(
+ Ifrit supports callbacks and async/await both :)

- Fuze-Swift have async/multithreading issues. Crashes is possible :(
+ Ifrit is stable and crash-free!

- Fuse-Swift's async functions return incorrect results - wrong indexes. :((((
+ Ifrit's async functions return correct indexes and are fully covered with tests :)

- Fuze-Swift was written for Xcode 11 and now generates numerous warnings :(
+ Ifrit's code is updated to the latest Swift standards and fully supports Swift 6 :) 
- But Ifrit have a few build warnings :(

+ Ifrit - extended coverage with automated tests :)
+ Ifrit features an additional search system using the Levenshtein distance algorithm. :)
+ Ifrit allows searching by multiple search templates
+ Ifrit's syntax has been slightly adjusted for improved flexibility
+ Ifrit's sync search is 2% faster than Fuse's (using M1 processor and standard settings).
+         Async search performance remains the same as Fuse's (standard settings).

+ Ifrit was ported to Kotlin programming language: https://github.com/dfabulich/skip-ifrit
